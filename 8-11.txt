Here’s a structured summary of the conversation from **11\_8.txt**:

---

## **Meeting Context**

* **Purpose:** Discuss open setup tasks for a new project, including access, environment configuration, and pilot application selection.
* **Participants:** Multiple team members including Vishwa, Nishant, and others.
* **Duration:** Quick daily check-in planned for the whole week to keep momentum.

---

## **Key Discussion Points**

### 1. **Access & Environment Setup**

* **Jira Setup:** Need to create and assign project stories.
* **Development Server / Enrollment:**

  * Namespace access required to start coding.
  * Access still pending despite ongoing follow-up.
* **Converge UI Access:**

  * Team lacks ability to log in and see the UI screen of the application.
  * Inspire portal roles (basic and Inspire roles) need to be assigned to allow access.
* **Inspire Integration:**

  * Standalone application available for initial testing.
  * Later integration with Inspire will require coordination with the algorithm team.

---

### 2. **Pilot Application Decision**

* **Requirements:** Medium-complexity app with some dependencies (e.g., Java or Node.js libraries, one database connection).
* **Options:**

  * Use an existing internal product for initial testing (already set up).
  * Choose a suitable app for pilot phase later.

---

### 3. **Jira Story Creation**

* Role restrictions mean not everyone can create stories.
* Action: Check with Suraj/Susan on granting rights to create Jira stories.
* Interim: One team member will create stories and assign them to the lead.

---

### 4. **Wildcat Project Access**

* **Wildcat 32 Data Access:**

  * Requires cluster information.
  * Assigned to Vikram to provide access.
  * Status: Recently escalated, Vikram to confirm readiness.

---

### 5. **API Subscription**

* To call APIs in different environments (including non-prod), team members must:

  1. Go to NS Infra portal.
  2. Subscribe for API access.
  3. This provides access to all environments via checkbox selection.

---

## **Action Items**

1. **Grant Converge UI & Inspire portal access** to team members.
2. **Resolve namespace access** for development enrollment.
3. **Confirm and set up pilot application** with required dependencies.
4. **Enable Jira story creation** for additional team members.
5. **Get cluster info for Wildcat 32 Data** from Vikram.
6. **Ensure team subscribes to APIs** for environment access.
